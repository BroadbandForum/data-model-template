  Summary:
  TR-069 Data Model Data Types.  Contains normative definitions of named (i.e.
  not built-in) data types that can be used in data model definitions.

  Version History:
  November 2008: tr-106-1-0-0-types.xml, corresponds to parts of TR-106
                 section 3.2, with some updates from Amendments 1 and 2.
  September 2009: tr-106-1-0-0-types.xml (name unchanged)
                 - replaced bibrefs with import from biblio file
                 - fixed cwmp-datamodel.xsd to be cwmp-datamodel-1-0.xsd
  May 2010: tr-106-1-0-0-types.xml (name unchanged)
                 - defined the IPPrefix and IPv4Address data types
                 - specified doctype entities to help simplify data type definitions

  <dataType name="IPAddress">
    <description>All IPv4 addresses and subnet masks are represented as strings in IPv4 dotted-decimal notation.  All IPv6 addresses MUST be represented using any of the 3 standard textual representations as defined in {{bibref|RFC3513}} Sections 2.2.1, 2.2.2 and 2.2.3.  Both lower-case and upper-case letters can be used.  Use of the lower-case letters is RECOMMENDED.  Examples of valid IPv6 address textual representations:
* 1080:0:0:800:ba98:3210:11aa:12dd
* 1080::800:ba98:3210:11aa:12dd
* 0:0:0:0:0:0:13.1.68.3
Unspecified or inapplicable IP addresses and subnet masks MUST be represented as empty strings unless otherwise specified by the parameter definition.</description>
    <string>
      <size maxLength="45"/>
    </string>
  </dataType>

  <dataType name="IPv4Address">
    <description>IPv4 addresses and subnet masks are represented as strings in IPv4 dotted-decimal notation.  
Unspecified or inapplicable IP addresses and subnet masks MUST be represented as empty strings unless otherwise specified by the parameter definition.</description>
    <string>
      <size maxLength="15"/>
      <pattern value=""/>
      <pattern value="(&octet;&dot;){3}&octet;"/>
    </string>
  </dataType>

  <dataType name="IPPrefix">
    <description>IPv4 or IPv6 routing prefix in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation {{bibref|RFC4632}}. This is specified as an IP address followed by an appended "/n" suffix, where ''n'' (the prefix size) is an integer in the range 0-32 (for IPv4) or 0-128 (for IPv6) that indicates the number of (leftmost) '1' bits of the routing prefix. 
IPv4 example: 192.168.1.0/24
IPv6 example: 2001:edff:fe6a:f76::/64
Unspecified or inapplicable IP prefixes MUST be represented as empty strings unless otherwise specified by the parameter definition.</description>
    <string>
      <size maxLength="49"/>
    </string>
  </dataType>

  <dataType name="MACAddress">
    <description>All MAC addresses are represented as strings of 12 hexadecimal digits (digits 0-9, letters A-F or a-f) displayed as six pairs of digits separated by colons.  Unspecified or inapplicable MAC addresses MUST be represented as empty strings unless otherwise specified by the parameter definition.</description>
    <string>
      <size maxLength="17"/>
