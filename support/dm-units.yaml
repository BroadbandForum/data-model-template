# this is a map keyed by units string; the map values can be:
#  - null (indicating that there are no aliases)
#  - a list of aliases (ordered from most to least preferred)
#  - a map with 'description', 'reference', 'aliases' keys, in which case
#    'aliases' is a list of aliases
# XXX including extra information (including, perhaps the units class: 'time',
#     'distance' etc.) would allow the report tool to include units string
#     documentation
