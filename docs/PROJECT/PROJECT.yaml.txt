  TR-106 specifies data model guidelines to be followed by all [CWMP] (TR-069)
  Endpoints and [USP] (TR-369) Agents. These guidelines include:

  * Structural requirements for the data hierarchy
  * Requirements for versioning of data models
  * Requirements for defining profiles

  As part of this data modeling framework, TR-106 defines two XML Schemas:

  * The *Data Modeling (DM) Schema*, which is used for defining all CWMP and
    USP data models. This makes data model definitions rigorous, and helps to
    reduce the danger that different implementations will interpret data
    model definitions in different ways.

  * The *Device Type (DT) Schema*, that allows a device to describe its
    supported CWMP data models. This description is both specific and
    detailed, allowing a Controller to know exactly what is supported by the
    device, including any vendor-specific objects and parameters. USP uses a
    different mechanism (GetSupportedDM message) for the same purpose; this
    mechanism is specified in [TR-369][USP].

  The TR-106 GitHub repository contains [the above schemas][schemas],
  [support files][support] (e.g., common bibliographic references and
  data types), and the [TR-106 specification source][specification].
  The rendered GitHub Pages documentation can be found at
  <https://data-model-template.broadband-forum.org>.

  The TR-106 schemas and support files are also available at the
  [CWMP data models] and [USP data models] sites. These sites present
  integrated views of the CWMP and USP versions of the standard data
  models, and provide a convenient way of viewing current and past
  versions of the schemas and support files in context.

      dm-types:

        text: |
          * Added an *Alias* component to reduce cut-and-paste in the data models

    changes:
      specification:
        text: |
          ::: USP :::
          * Updated the *Mountable Object* and *Mount Point* descriptions to
            indicate that all top-level objects (other than mount points) are
            mountable
          * Updated path scoping rules to indicate that a path that starts
            with a period (`.`) is relative to its mount point (if mounted)
            or to the Root or Service Object (otherwise)
          :::
          * Updated the *hidden* and *secured* attributes to clarify that they
            can't both be set to *true*, and that for CWMP *secured* means
            the same as *hidden*
          * Tightened the *version* attribute definition. It can only be
            used when the version is later than the parent version,
            except that it always has to be specified for Objects and
            Profiles. Also added a new section on the use of the *version*
            attribute
          * Clarified that defaults defined in components will be "promoted"
            to *parameter* defaults when used in command or event arguments
          * Fixed the rules governing modifications of existing models. The
            basic rule is that the value space can only be expanded, never
            contracted
          * Added a new section on the DMR (Data Model Report) Schema
      dm-schema:
        resname: cwmp-datamodel-1-10.xsd
        text: |
          * Supported XSD v1.1, which allows more rigorous validation, e.g.,
            use of appropriate attributes when creating and modifying items
          * Added defaults for various attributes, e.g. *access*, *minEntries*
            and *maxEntries* default to *readOnly*, *1* and *1* respectively
          * Deprecated the *mountType* attribute's *none* and *mountable*
            values, because mountable objects are now determined automatically
          * Made the *uniqueKey/functional* and the *command/async*
            attributes mandatory
          * Relaxed rules governing the order of top-level elements such as
            *import*, *dataType* and *component*; they can now occur in any
            order
          * Tightened up the use of *dmr:* attributes, which can now only be
            used on elements where they make sense
          * Fixed a few bugs, e.g., added a *template* element uniqueness check
      dmr-schema:
        resname: cwmp-datamodel-report-1-0.xsd
        text: |
          * Added *noUnitsTemplate* to suppress "missing *{{units}}*
            template" warnings
          * Added *previousCommand* and *previousEvent* attributes
      dt-schema:
        resname: cwmp-devicetype-1-10.xsd
        text: |
          * Updated to reference latest published DM Schema version (v1.10)
          * Note that the DT Schema is v1.10 to match the DM Schema (DT
            Schema v1.7, v1.8 and v1.9 were skipped)
