  How to use the data model schema to understand and develop CWMP/USP
  data models
"summary": |
  See <https://data-model-template.broadband-forum.org> for the
  current TR-106 specification.
"description": |
  TR-106 specifies data model guidelines to be followed by all [CWMP] (TR-069)
  Endpoints and [USP] (TR-369) Agents. These guidelines include:

  * Structural requirements for the data hierarchy
  * Requirements for versioning of data models
  * Requirements for defining profiles

  As part of this data modeling framework, TR-106 defines two XML Schemas:

  * The *Data Modeling (DM) Schema*, which is used for defining all CWMP and
    USP data models. This makes data model definitions rigorous, and helps to
    reduce the danger that different implementations will interpret data
    model definitions in different ways.

  * The *Device Type (DT) Schema*, that allows a device to describe its
    supported CWMP data models. This description is both specific and
    detailed, allowing a Controller to know exactly what is supported by the
    device, including any vendor-specific objects and parameters. USP uses a
    different mechanism (GetSupportedDM message) for the same purpose; this
    mechanism is specified in [TR-369][USP].

  The TR-106 GitHub repository contains [the above schemas][schemas],
  [support files][support] (e.g., common bibliographic references and
  data types), and the [TR-106 specification source][specification].
  The rendered GitHub Pages documentation can be found at
  <https://data-model-template.broadband-forum.org>.

  The TR-106 schemas and support files are also available at the
  [CWMP data models] and [USP data models] sites. These sites present
  integrated views of the CWMP and USP versions of the standard data
  models, and provide a convenient way of viewing current and past
  versions of the schemas and support files in context.
